# Astria v13

Astria is an extensible web interface connecting complex teams to complex data.
  
  
Once installed and connected to a database, Astria generates a complete website which allows your teams of users to access and edit the data in the tables.
  
You can completely customize which groups of users can see or edit which data. You can also create alternative custom pages to replace the procedurally generated pages for each table.

By default, user authentication is entrusted to highly secure vendors like Google and Facebook. Your users will enjoy one-click sign in through these highly secure vendors. If you prefer, there is an opt-in feature which allows you to use the far less secure method of authenticating with email accounts.

Currently, MySQL is supported. The plan is to eventually add support for many more database engines.
